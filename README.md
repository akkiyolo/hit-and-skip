This is a dynamic and interactive image rating web application where users can upload their own images and rank them against each other in a "Hot or Not" style competition.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Description

"Hit or Skip" is a fun, client-side game that allows users to determine the best image from a collection. After uploading images, the app presents two at a time, and the user chooses the "hit" or skips the pair. Behind the scenes, an **Elo rating system** adjusts the scores of the images based on the outcome of each comparison, making every choice matter. The game is built entirely on the front-end using **session storage**, meaning the leaderboard and images are unique to each user's current session.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Bulk Image Upload**: Users can easily upload multiple images from their device to begin a new game session.
* **Head-to-Head Battles**: The core of the game displays two random images for the user to compare.
* **Elo Rating System**: Each image starts with a base rating of **1400**. A win increases an image's rating while a loss decreases it, creating a fair and competitive ranking.
* **Interactive Choices**: Simple "HIT" and "SKIP" buttons make for fast-paced and intuitive gameplay.
* **Live Leaderboard**: A real-time leaderboard ranks all images by their current rating, also displaying the total number of hits and skips for each.
* **Session-Based**: The entire experience is powered by browser **session storage**, ensuring user privacy as all data is cleared when the tab is closed.
